# Auto Accident Dataset Lab

Dataset was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xavierberge/road-accident-dataset

## Project Overview

This project performs data cleaning and preprocessing on an auto accident dataset in order to uncover trends in accident occurrences such as location and severity.  

## Dataset

This is a large dataset, with 23 columns and just over 300,000 rows. The data provides details on where the accident occurred, weather conditions, vehicle and roadway type, and more.  The data was collected from the UK, as evidenced by the latitude/longitude and which local authority handled each accident.

## Visualizations

The graphs included in this Jupyter Notebook aim to demonstrate both when accidents occurred as well as occurrance in Rural vs. Urban areas and the distribution of severity.
